# Meeting Notes

## Attendees:
* Mikes
* Afifa
* Sayan

### Time: 12:30--1:30pm

## Notes:
- reviewed code structure of neurotech starter code
  - identified a few redundancies in code
    - main function has lots of commented-out lines of code that aren't needed
    - we are using plugin system with an observable observer pattern to run an external observable-observer pattern
      - (when I originally started contributing to the code plugins were being very weird and not accepting external packages ... maybe i was writing plugins wrong?)

## Todo for next meeting (Monday Oct 16 2016, 6:00-8:00pm):
- clean up and thoroughly document existing code base
- (if we have time) run tests with newly cleaned electrodes)
  - look at electrodes to see if they are damaged or not)
