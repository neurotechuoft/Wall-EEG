Notes

Alex: want to look into anxiety in general
  -James: need to define rigorous variables for science papers!
    -Alex: but meditation is a holistic thing! (with many different vars)
      James: usually scientists admit this, but just looks into one var -- allows for controlling of confounding vars -> more rigorous science
  -James: feedback system good cuz it boils problem down to black box: inputs and outputs
    -vary inputs and see how outputs change
Defining meditative state:
  -need to quantitavely define meditation with vars (from literature)
  -Sayan:
    -relaxation through concentration
    -lower diversity of brain activity
    -lower physiological stress
  -Aatina:
    -focus time increase longitudinally
  -Alex:
    -very hard to define
    -from his experiene meditating, it's not just concentration and relaxation
      -most programs: at first its consciousness, but then it opens outwards
      -so we can do 'basic meditation' with breathing, etc or monk meditation
        -James: types of physiological changes will be similar (but actual delta's different)
          -(have been studied)
  -Amatulla:
    -meditation subjective to each person
      -different things are meditation to different people
    -focusing on yourself
      -ie: focusing on your # of breath
      -being conscious of yourself
  -state of augmented awareness?
  -making/breaking frame
    -understanding that different perspectives of the same object exist, and being able to switch between them
    -ie: bunny/duck (a bunny that looks like a duck/a duck that looks like a bunny)
  -Alissa:
    -maybe we are defining n forms as 'meditation'
Placebo?
  -perhaps sham software?
    -like no feedback loop
Tasks
-literature search on psychology/neuroscience of meditation (monk study, etc)
  -look at vars used, methodology, etc
    -find what vars we can measure
Stages:
-first do literature search, see what we get (define meditative state in terms of vars, define entering into a meditative state)
-second: what can we design to faciliate process? (based on what process is defined from literature search)
  -third: develop code, hardware
  
Misc:
  -ask profs to use their students as guinea pigs?
  -factor analysis, principal component analysis
    -if you have complex system and need to see how all the factors affect particular outcome, these statistical tests show relevance of each var
  -Amatulla: what if these people also start meditating outside of sessions?
    -James, Allysa: just ask them :P
      -and split into habitual meditators and non-habitual meditators
