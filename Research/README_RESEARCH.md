This is a research article that’s mostly interested in the effect certain mental tasks have on (specifically) delta bands. The first experiment they did should be more applicable to us; the participants were shown a hard math question (in essence, what Paul suggested), and were told to solve it, then say the answer out loud. The type of questions the study used were like “(85/5)6”. This type of internal mental task was found to have increased delta activity. The study used a lot more electrodes, but they did include electrodes at location Fp1 and Fp2… Which is what I assume Muse measures…. (I am sorry if I’m wrong, everything I’m writing in this paragraph is based on this assumption). In the discussion, the researchers also mentioned in their discussion that activities that require “a state of internal concentration” also lead to a delta increase. This led me to think infer that we could use also meditation, which is the main purpose of Muse, no?
TLDR: hard mental math, yoga, meditation?

This is also a research article that’s not super applicable to us, since it deals with differentiating and comparing the left and right frontal cortices between pleasant/unpleasant and intense/calm stimuli. Also, the placements of the electrodes were not in the Fp1 and Fp2 locations; they were placed in the F3 and F4 regions. I just thought the article was interesting because of a point it brings up: different types of music induce “different affective states.” The study looks at alpha bands, and has 4 different classifications for music (intense-unpleasant [fear], intense-pleasant [joy], calm-unpleasant [sad], calm-pleasant [happy]). Since I have no clue what would happen if we did try this—or if we can even get some kind of measureable response from the Muse—I thought it would be cool to try it (if you guys want).
TLDR; maybe try listening to different types of music (that elicits different states of mind, like sadness or something that makes you want to dance) and see if there’s any appreciable change in brain activity that can be measured by our Muses… ensure that the songs suit the Muse wearer’s taste
